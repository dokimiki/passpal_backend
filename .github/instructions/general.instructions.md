## 1. Project Purpose

This backend provides the API and DB for **PassPal**, an app for Chukyo University students to improve usability of the university's official portals.
It manages users, courses, classes, assignments, attendance logs, device tokens, notifications, and ratings.

**Authentication:**

- All endpoints except `/signup` require Firebase Authentication (JWT Bearer Token, see Swagger).

---

## 2. Domain Model & Key Tables

### 2.1 Courses (Course Master)

- **courses:** University-wide master for course titles and main instructor.
  - (e.g., "Intro to Computer Science", lead: "Yamada Taro")

- **course_ratings:** User reviews (star 1-5 + comment) for courses.

**Rules:**

- `title` + `lead_instructor` is unique.
- Each user can rate a course only once.

---

### 2.2 Users

- **users:** Application users, keyed by `firebase_uid`.
  - Supports "banned" flag and reason.

- **user_devices:** Each device (FCM token + OS) registered by a user.
  - Supports multiple devices per user.

---

### 2.3 Classes

- **classes:** A _class_ is an instance of a course in a specific term and with a MaNaBo class ID.
  - (e.g., "2025_Spring", MaNaBoID: "CS101", linked to a `course`)

- **class_notifiers:** Users who want notifications for a class.

---

### 2.4 Assignments

- **assignments:** Each assignment belongs to a class and has a unique MaNaBo directory/assignment ID.
  - `status` is 'opened' or 'deleted'.
  - `open_at` and `due_at` can be null (optional).
  - Uniqueness: (class_id, manabo_directory_id, manabo_assignment_id)

---

### 2.5 Attendance

- **attendance_logs:** User-submitted attendance logs for a given term, date, weekday, period.
  - `status` is one of \['present', 'absent', 'late']

---

### 2.6 Notification Reports

- **notification_reports:** Users report assignment notifications (appeared/changed/disappeared) for backend tracking.
  - Used for shared notifications among users.

---

## 3. Enumerations

- assignment_status_enum: 'opened', 'deleted'
- report_type_enum: 'appeared', 'changed', 'disappeared'
- attendance_status_enum: 'present', 'absent', 'late'
- weekday_enum: 'monday'...'sunday'
- device_os_enum: 'ios', 'android', 'web'

---

## 4. API Conventions

- **Pagination:** Most list endpoints support `page`, `per_page` params and return `meta`.
- **Error Handling:** All endpoints return standard error objects (`code`, `message`) for unauthorized, forbidden, not found, etc.
- **Security:** Except `/signup`, all endpoints require a valid Firebase ID token as Bearer.

---

## 5. Typical Feature Flows

### 5.1 Class Registration & Notification

1. When a student registers a class, link or create course master if needed.
2. To receive assignment notifications for a class, register with `/classes/{classId}/notifications`.

### 5.2 Assignment Management

- Each assignment links to a class, is uniquely identified within that class.
- New/updated assignments can be reported via `/notification-reports` for cross-user notification.

### 5.3 Attendance Logs

- Users can submit, update, delete attendance logs per term and period.
- Attendance logs are not linked to a specific class, but to (date, period, weekday, term, user).

### 5.4 Course Ratings

- Users can submit one rating per course; update or delete allowed.
- Ratings include star (1-5) and optional comment.

---

## 6. Special/Attention Points

- **MaNaBo IDs:** All class and assignment relationships are mapped via external MaNaBo IDs (class/dir/assignment).
- **Unique Constraints:** Follow the composite unique constraints as defined in the schema to prevent duplicates.
- **Device Management:** Multiple devices per user are supported; deleting device tokens removes only that device's FCM token.

---

## 7. Naming & Conventions

- Use **snake_case** for DB columns, **camelCase** for API/DTO fields (e.g., `lead_instructor` â†’ `leadInstructor`).
- All UUIDs use `uuid_generate_v7()`.

---

## 8. Sample Data Relationships

- A **user** can rate many **courses**, attend many **classes**, submit many **attendance_logs** and **notification_reports**.
- A **class** is for one term+MaNaBoClassID, belongs to a **course**, has many **assignments**, many **notifiers** (users).
- An **assignment** belongs to one class, identified by MaNaBo Directory/Assignment IDs.

---

## 9. Migration & Auditing

- All tables have `created_at`, `updated_at` (automatically set on update).
- Use triggers for `updated_at`.

---

## 10. For LLM/Copilot

- Always reflect business rules and unique constraints from the DB in your service logic and tests.
- When in doubt about relationships, **refer to the comments in the SQL schema.**
- Follow enum values exactly.
- Implement error handling as specified in the OpenAPI for all endpoints.
